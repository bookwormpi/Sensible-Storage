## üì¶ Installation

### Requirements
- **Minecraft**: 1.21.5
- **Fabric Loader**: 0.16.14 or higher
- **Fabric API**: Required
- **Java**: 21 or higher

### Steps
1. Download the latest release from the [Releases page](https://github.com/bookwormpi/sensiblestorage/releases)
2. Install [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use/) for Minecraft 1.21.5
3. Download [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api)

## üéÆ Usage

### Setting Up Memory Slots

1. **Open any container** (chest, barrel, etc.)
2. **Click the brain icon** üß† button on the right side to enter memorization mode
   - Gray button = memorization mode off
   - Green button = memorization mode on
3. **Click on slots** while in memorization mode to set memory templates:
   - **Left-click**: Set the item in your cursor as the memory template
   - **Right-click**: Clear the memory template for that slot
4. **Click the brain icon again** to exit memorization mode

### Using Memory Slots

- **Ghost Items**: Empty slots with memory templates show a translucent preview of the expected item
- **Smart Filtering**: You can only place items that match the memory template in each slot
- **Persistent Memory**: Templates are automatically saved and restored between sessions


### Commands

- `/sensiblestorage memory stats` - View memory statistics

## üîß Configuration

Memory templates are automatically saved to `.minecraft/sensiblestorage/` and persist across game sessions. No manual configuration required!

- Barrels
